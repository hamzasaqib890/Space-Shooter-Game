Relatively simple game. Use right and left arrow keys to move side to side.

Hold spacebar to shoot. Watch the cooldown on the left! The closer your cooldown bar gets to red, the faster you shoot.

However, if you let the bar completely deplete then you will need to dodge asteroids as you wait for it to refill.

You start with three lives but lose one each time you, or the mega ship you're tasked with protecting, gets hit.

Luckily, you start with a shield but one hit will take it out! Get to 500 score to initiate the shield again.


### Don't forget to occasionally take a moment to admire the beautiful parallax background of the stars.
